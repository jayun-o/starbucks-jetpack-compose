# Starbucks App (Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform)
Developed a full-featured cross-platform Starbucks E-commerce application using Kotlin Multiplatform and Jetpack Compose Multiplatform, sharing the entire UI layer across Android and iOS.
The app follows a Clean, Multi-modular Architecture with the MVVM pattern for scalability and maintainability.
Implemented Firebase Authentication for Email/Password and Google Sign-In, Cloud Firestore for real-time data, Firebase Storage for product images, and Cloud Functions for automated order confirmation emails.
Integrated PayPal API and Pay on Delivery options for checkout, along with push notifications powered by Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
Includes an Admin Panel for product management (CRUD operations) and dynamic Material 3 theming.
Focused on building a production-ready, modern, scalable E-commerce solution with real-world architecture and Firebase backend integration.
